Updated PRD: Fixing the "Day One" Silence (Slack Notification Onboarding)
1. The "Why" (Context)
Let’s be honest: right now, the first five minutes of using our app feels a bit broken. When a user downloads Slack, they’re usually doing it because they need to stay in the loop. But currently, we don't even ask them how they want to be reached.
We’re essentially handing them a walkie-talkie but leaving the volume turned all the way down. If they don’t happen to stumble into the settings menu, they miss DMs, deadlines, and mentions. The only way they know something happened is if they manually open the app—which, for a communication tool, is pretty much useless.
2. The Goal
We want to make sure no user ever says, "Oh, I didn't see your message because I didn't get a notification." We’re adding a simple, human-friendly "handshake" at the start. We want to give users the power to decide exactly how loud they want Slack to be before they even see their first message.
3. What We’re Fixing (The Problem)
The Information Blackout: New users are missing critical pings because notifications aren't configured by default.
The "Hide and Seek" Settings: Users shouldn't have to go on a treasure hunt through the "Preferences" menu just to make the app work.
The Industry Gap: Every other app that matters (Banking, Uber, Instagram) asks this on Day 1. By skipping it, Slack feels behind the curve and slightly "off."
4. The Solution (The "Handshake")
We’re inserting one clear, easy-to-read screen into the onboarding flow. No technical jargon—just a simple question: "How do you want to stay updated?"
The Four Choices:
Everything: "I don't want to miss a thing." (All messages)
The Essentials: "Just tell me when someone needs me." (Mentions & DMs)
The Quiet Room: "Only break through for 1-on-1s." (DMs only)
Manual Mode: "I’ll check the app when I’m ready." (Off)
5. What Success Looks Like
We’ll know this worked if:
Retention goes up: People actually use the app because it’s actually telling them things.
Notification "Enabled" rates climb: More users are "plugged in" from the start.
Fewer "Silent" Users: We see a drop in users who have the app installed but don't respond to messages for 24+ hours.
6. Personal Touch / Final Note
This isn't just about adding another screen to the flow. It’s about respecting the user’s time. We’re giving them the remote control to their own attention. It’s a small change, but it’s the difference between Slack being a tool they rely on versus an app they forget about.
